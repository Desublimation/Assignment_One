For this Assignment the time I used is too much, I start it on Wednesday, but I finished it on Saturday, the reason why it cost me so much time is that I knew nothing about C# language, so there are so many time was spent on searching the syntax, and learn how to use it. Also, because I didnâ€™t formula with C#, I have to using java to simply code to check the logic firstly. So, I will grade my efficient for this assignment as 3 of 10.

The time to learn the how to use Visual studio, how to create library and console, and build a relationship between these two things costs 2 hours from me.
The time to brainstorm about the structure for this Assignment costs about 4 hours from me
The time to coding by Java costs 8 hours from me
The time to translate from Java to C# costs 6 hours from me including learn C# syntax
The time to write test costs and debug my code costs 8 hours from me
The time to write the documentation costs 1.5 hours from me.
